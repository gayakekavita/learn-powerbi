-Calculated columns allow you to add new , formula-based columns to tables in a model.
-Calculated columns refer to entire table or columns.
-Calculated columns generate values for each row , which are visible within tables in the Data view.
-Calculated columns understand row context ,they are great for defining properties based on information in each row ,but genarally useless for aggregration.
-Calculated columns are typically used for filtering and grouping data,rather than creating aggregrate  numerical values.


-------------------------DAX
--For creating new column
 Syntax:
column_name=IF(logicaltest, Resulttrue,Resultfalse)


Quantity Type = IF(
    'Sales Data'[OrderQuantity]>1 ,
     "Multiple items",
     "Single Item"
    )

-Measures are DAX formulas used to generate new calculated values.
- use measures to create numerical,calculated values that can be analyzed in the "values" field of a report visual.
-Two types of measures:
   1. Implicit measures
   2.Explicit measures
-Implicit measures are created when you drag raw numerical fields into a report visual and manually select an aggregration mode(Sum, Average, Min, Max ,Count, etc).
-Explicit measures are created when you actually write a DAX formula and define a new measure that can be used within the model.
-Implicit measures are only accessible within the specific visulization in which they were created and cannot be referenced elsewhwhere.
-Explicit measures can be used anywhere in the report ,and referenced by other DAX calculation to create "measure trees".


--Quick measures automatically create formulas based on pre-built templates or natural language prompts.
-Quick measures calculations can be used to build measures using predefined templates .
-Quick measure suggestions can be used to find suggested measures based on natural language queries .

--Pro Tip:
Measure Table :
Its common best practice to create a dedicated table to store your measures ;
This will help you stay organized ,find measures quickly and allow group related measures into folders.
Option 1:
         1.Go to Report View .
         2.Click on 'Enter Data' into power query .It will load the table to the data model -table is visible in Power  
            Query.
         3.Add a table name and click Ok to load the data model.
Option 2:(Using DAX):
         1.Go to table view.
         2. click on 'New table'.
         3. DAX expression editor will be open .
         4.  Write DAX expression.
             Measure Table(DAX) = {" "}
             [This DAX expression will create a table called as 'Measure Table(DAX)' with one row and one column of empty     
              value].
