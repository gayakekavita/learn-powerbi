-we cannot connect two fact(numeric tables) tables directly we can establish relationship between two fact tables through dimensions table.
-we can establish relationship between fact table and dimension table.
-we cannot establish relationship between two fact tables.
-Two types of structure:
   1.star structure.
   2.snow fake structure.

-two types of filters are available in the tables while establishing the relationship between them.
  1. single
  2.both 
 -by default it uses single cross filter.
 -if you want to change it from single to both then click on the arrow on the relationship line go to properties and select 
  cross filter option to "both".

----------------------------------------------
hiding fields:
-Hide in the Report View makes fields inaccessible from Report tab, but still available in Data and Model View.
-This can be controlled by right clicking a field in the data or Model view ,or by selecting 'is hidden'
 in the properties pane.
-This is commonly used to prevent users from filtering using invalid fields,reduce clutter,or to hide irrelevant 
 metrics from view.

--Pro tip:
   Hide the foreign key in fact(numeric) tables to force users to filter using primary key in dimensions table.

-------------------------model layouts
-Default model layout is 'All tables'.
-We can create custom layout by simply clicking on '+' sign at the bottom of home page.
-We can add one or more tables.
-We can add related tables by simply clicking on right click of the table and select 'All related tables'.
-We should remove the tables from custom layout if you dont want it, but if you select delete option it will deleted from the main model also.
-So prefer remove option instead of delete.
